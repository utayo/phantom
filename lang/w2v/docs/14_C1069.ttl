This is an undergraduate level econometrics course. In this course, we will start with a review of probability and statistics that are the basics of econometrics. After studying a linear regression model with one regressor, together with its statistical inferences, we will extend our models so that we can have more than one regressor. Issues that interfere with desirable properties of our estimators, such as errors that have autocorrelation or heterosckedasticity, will then be studied. The last part of this course will be devoted to regression with binary dependent variables, instrumental variable regression, and time series regression.

Learning outcomes After completing this course, the successful students will be able to: compute least squares coefficients using a computer; interpret the result of simple/multiple linear regression; and identify a situation where the least square method is inappropriate and take corrective actions.
