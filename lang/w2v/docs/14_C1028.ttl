Most of us live in a city and share the space with the other people. We live in a house, use public transportation, go to school or work, shop and eat, and enjoy parks. We often take those for granted and overlook the meaning of the spaces to us. In this class, we explore how the cities around us work and why they have been built as they are now. Historically the cities were built by the authorities such as governments. They laid out the infrastructure and tried to lead the built environment suitable for their purposes. In contrast to this traditional planning, the ideas that the users, residents and visitors, discover how they can live and use the city, “machizukuri”, has become widely accepted and supported recently. This class will explore, through an interdisciplinary approach, how the idea of “planning” and “machizukuri” are developed and applied, the differences in Japan and the other parts of the world (especially cases in the United States) and eventually discuss the future of our cities.

";
Through different disciplinary-based lenses; including urban design, planning, sociology, government and politics, historic preservation and others; the class will examine the notion of urban/city planning in relation to "machizukuri", and the opportunities it offers and the challenges it faces. The issues will be investigated through readings, class discussions and papers/projects as student’s work. The overall goals of the course are to assist students in understanding how the cities are built, what planning’s role is, and how we can participate in the planning process.
