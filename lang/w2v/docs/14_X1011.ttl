Course Objective ----------------- (This is an online joint course with Columbia University students. Keio University students will log on to Adobe Connect (i.e., a real-time online remote learning environment), to attend lectures, engage in discussions, and collaborate with Columbia University students.)	 The course will cover the different approaches to educational technology in a global setting. The goal of the course is to introduce students to many of the ideas, theories, and practices associated with the field of educational technology, computer-mediated communication (CMC), distance learning, and the development of a global curriculum. The course examines the importance of (a) content, pedagogy, and culture, (b) the role of the instructor and students in creating successful online learning environments, and (c) strengths and weaknesses of communication tools and educational technology in creating blended online learning environments. The course aims at helping students identify the benefits and shortcomings of technology, explore how to enhance dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, and examine how to capitalize on the strengths of audio and visual images to accompany other formats of instructional materials. Culture, experience, values, and religious backgrounds are valuable resources to promote joint education and collaboration research, but often left out because of the difficulty in integrating it into existing curriculums and generic remote environments. To effectively design useful learning environments, one needs to consider both the technological resources available, as well as student’s unique backgrounds.

Course requirements -------------------- The course will be meeting online in Adobe Connect (Students only need to click on a WWW URL link that will log them onto a web site). The course requirement: - Online Class attendance and participation in class discussions (Can access class online do not need to appear at physical classroom) - Two short reflection papers (2-3pages) - Final paper (7-9 pages) There is NO midterm or final exam.

この授業は慶應大学の学生と米国コロンビア大学の学生との合同授業である。 授業はビデオ会議機能を用いてオンラインでリアルタイムに行われる。

ITの応用が実用性だけでなくソーシャルな役割（コミュニケーションツール）も果たすようになった。この講義ではさまざまなオンライン教育環境（例： Adobe Connect, Second Life）、 学びのプロセス(social learning process), 認知と行動(cognition & behavior) などが教育関連の情報技術(Educational technology)とどのように結びついているか、教育環境をどのように変化させているかを探る。教育理論(Theory)、Human computer interaction、教育心理(Educational Psychology)、学習科学(Learning Science)、認知発達学 (Cognitive Development)、遠隔教育(Distance Learning) と関連する分野も交えて紹介する。Adobe Connect (and if time allows, in Virtual Reality Second Life) にてグローバルなカリキュラムを作成する実験や課題なども遠隔で取り組む。

授業はオンラインで行われ オンライン授業への出席とディスカッションへの参加 小レポート（各２～３ページ）が２本 最終レポートが１本（７～９ページ） 中間試験及び学期末試験は行わない
