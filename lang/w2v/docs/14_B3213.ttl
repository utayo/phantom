Some people view daily life itself as an optimization problem: how do you get the most out of a set of limited resources, including time, space, food, fuel, materials, or money? How do you find the best path to a destination, or maximize the profit for your company? Some such problems sound gauzy and vague. How can we turn those problems into concrete formulations so that we can quantify success or failure? Are there simple methods for finding optimal solutions, and how can we prove that our solution is optimal? This class introduces the topics in a form friendly those interested in everything from business to computer networking to mathematics.

";
This class is a gentle introduction to optimization. Indeed, "A Gentle Introduction to Optimization" is the title of the textbook. This class will be a basic lecture format with regular homeworks. Each homework set will be a few easily solved mathematical problems.

The students will select their own final project, which will form a significant fraction of the grade.

第1回 Introduction
example applications 
background: linear algebra 
definition of linear programs 
definition of integer programs 
第2回 Problems on Graphs and in Networking
shortest path 
spanning tree 
perfect matching 
第3回 Solving Linear Problems: Certificates
Infeasible problems and their certificates 
Unbounded problems and their certificates 
Certificates of optimality 
第4回 Solving Linear Problems: The Simplex Algorithm
The simplex algorithm is one of the first modern algorithms, and is 
surprisingly broadly applicable and durable, despite apparently 
having theoretical drawbacks. 
第5回 Duality Examples 1
The concept of "duality" figures strongly in optimization. We will 
see how it works using examples in shortest path first.
第6回 Duality Examples 2
Minimum cost perfect matching.

第10回 Integer Problems 2
第11回 Computational Complexity
Big-O Notation 
Complexity Classes 
P, NP, NP hard, NP complete 
Bigger-than-NP classes 
Just because it's polynomial doesn't mean it's easy 
Just because it's exponential doesn't mean it's hard 
第12回 Nonlinear Optimization
