This subject is a descriptive one. Explains in photos, animation and drawings the basics of both mechanical and materials engineering. No mathematical complications will be included. It is necessary to all students especially those who are studying issues not related to engineering but will work in future in an Engineering Firm be it a maker of sellers of machinery or materials. Even those who may not work in such an environment, the subject will be helpful for them in their daily life when dealing with machines and materials.

";
The course aims at introducing the principles of Mechanics and Materials Engineering. It will help students understand how machines are designed and how they are working. Also students will be able to understand how to select the proper material for any specific application. The course is vital for those who are interested in technology and those who would like to work in future for any manufacturer even though the work may be marketing or administrative. Although the course seems to be heavy and include difficult subjects, but it will be a descriptive course with almost no mathematical complications so that all students from different backgrounds will be able to understand it.
