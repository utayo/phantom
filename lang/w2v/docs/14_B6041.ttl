Cities and buildings can be seen as spatial containers created to support the lives and activities of humanity, which has endured in all kinds of environments and under an impressive range of circumstances in its long history. Architecture can be categorized by its purposes, as in housing, temple/church, public institution (theater, museum, city hall); by its size; or by the use of materials or structural system that is employed. Cities, which are formed by the aggregation of buildings, vary in size and composition as a result of their location and purpose. The style and form of both architecture and city is developed in the wake of a shifting cultural background and history. In this class students will examine the historical development of architecture and city, and will learn basic terms and expressions.

「都市」と「建築」は、人間が長い時間をかけて作り出してきた人工環境の中でも特に人々の生活・活動を引き受ける空間的な器としてかたちづくられ、人間のさまざまな営みを支えてきた。建築（architecture）は、その目的に応じて住宅、宮殿、宗教建築(社寺や教会)、公共施設(劇場、美術館、市役所)などさまざまな類型に分類され,またその材料や架構によって大小各種の空間を作り出してきた。建築が集合し、人々が集って居住する都市(city)も、その成立基盤に従って城下町や港町などに分かれ,規模や装いを違えている。いずれも長い歴史に裏づけられ、その文化的背景に応じた形式と様式をそなえてきた。本授業は、建築と都市の歴史的側面に特に着目し、その発展を追うと同時に、それぞれの時代背景に応じた基本語彙,空間言語を習得することを目的としている。

For all students: Through the studies and observation of historical cities and buildings, which have crystalized most part of human activities until today, students are expected to learn the roll of the society that made possible these material and visual cultures; conversely, it is important to know what kind of impact architecture and city have had upon human society and how this relationship has changed through history.

For architects-to-be and those who want to be involved in architectural design, town planning, etc.: It is strongly recommended to get familiar with as many examples of architectural styles, details, techniques, structures, housing types, or urban forms as soon as possible which would constitute an important part of their professional background. It is also recommended that they learn to relativize the contemporary architecture and urbanism in a larger historical context.

In this lecture, many visual materials such as plans, pictures, videos, computer graphics, models, etc. will be used. However, architecure or urban structure is sometimes hard to understand without being there. It is strongly recommended, in this sense, for the students to visit some historical buildings to comprehend how the space was structured or designed.

In each lecture different historical, geographical or stylistic group of architecture/city is explained with each lexicon and terminology. However, all the architecture/city will be analysed using common keywords such as diversification of style, relationship between construction and design, etc. Besides the final presentation, there will be a mid-term assignment (groupwork model-making or an essay). A small presentation by each student is also planned.
