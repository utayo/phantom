　The world’s nations face rapid aging, and in Japan’s unprecedented super aging society, 30% of the population will be 65 or older by 2030, rising to 40% by 2055. The world’s eyes are upon Japan to see how we handle this situation. Publicly-financed medical care costs exceed 33 trillion yen, and are climbing by one trillion yen annually. I believe that this severe crisis presents itself, on the contrary, as an opportunity to share our accumulated know-how with the global nations in similar straits. The average human lifespan in Japan is 80.9 years, 74.5 of them lived in reasonable health, leaving 6.4 years spent in a bedridden or similar state. Approximately 66% of lifelong medical expenses occur after age 60, with about half remaining after age 70, and some 20% occurring during the final year of life. However, recent research suggests that medical care costs do not expand with a longer life; in fact, healthy longevity sees across-the-board decreases in medical care costs. In other words, achieving healthy longevity not only results in a better QOL (quality of life) for the vital individual and family, but also positively impacts rising publicly-financed medical care costs.

世界中の国々が急速に高齢化に向かっているが、日本における超高齢化社会は世界に例を見ないスピードで進行しており、６５歳以上の人口が２０３０年には３０％、２０５５年には４０％を超えると推定されており、我が国がどのように対処していくか、世界中が注目している状況である。３３兆円を超える国の医療財政は毎年１兆円の伸びを示し、大変厳しい状況であるが、この危機的状況は逆にチャンスであり、今後、世界の多くの国が直面する同様の状況にそのノウハウを提供することができると考える。 人の平均的な一生は寿命が８０，９歳、健康寿命が７４，５歳で死亡前の６，４年は寝たきりなどの状態になる。また、生涯医療費の約６６％は６０歳以降、約５０％は７０歳以降に、そして死亡１年前の終末期医療費は約２０％を消費される。しかしながら、最近の研究では長寿で医療費は増加せず、むしろ健康長寿では大幅に軽減されることが分かっている。つまり健康長寿が実現されればピンピンコロリで本人や家族のＱＯＬが向上するばかりでなく増加する医療財政にも好影響を与えることになる。

This class is aimed toward the foundation of biochemistry related with health. Students are expected to investigate a suitable paper and give a presentation each time.
