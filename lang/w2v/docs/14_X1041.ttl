This subject is complementary to other existing courses that tackle issues related to design. Thus students across all three faculties and the graduate schools will find this course applicable to them. Since SFC aims to prepare students to engage all kind of issues related to the society, Ergonomics will be a good addition to the knowledge of the graduates.

";
The course aims at introducing the principles of ergonomics and design thinking so that students are able to make the best design that fits the needs of a specific population. The course also raise the design sense and ability to find solutions to problems related to the design of products, services or even a building with consideration to human body activities, anthropometric data, human mind abilities, and differences between people. Consideration is given to usability and user centered design which are both an important issues that make products or services more comfortable to use.

第1回 What is Ergonomics?
Brief history, Definition and importance of ergonomics, Type of problem/mismatch found in every day activity, product or service. 
Report: Find your optimal product, or criticize a product. Students has to pick up a product or service or even a building and find the advantages and disadvantages in the design. Personal impression is enough.

第2回 Design Thinking
Design process and what should we do in every stage of the process.

第3回 The Ergonomics Knowledge base
Anatomical and Mechanical Structure of human body, anthropometry and anthropometric data.

第4回 How the body and mind work?
Energy requirements at work, mind information process and use of sensory capabilities. 
Report: Make an Anthropometric data base. Students can measure or use available data and observe the differences between genders, and nations. Then learn how to compare between them, and how to use the data in designing a product or a service.

第5回 Thinking about people
Human capabilities in Learning, reasoning and memory. Contexts of use and requirements generation and PACT Analysis 
Report: Do a PACT Analysis for a project (system, product, or service).

第6回 Ergonomic Factors
Kinds of Ergonomic Factors at work, MSDs, risk factors, and Prevention Strategies. 
Report: Generate requirements for a system or a product. 
Much care has to be given to Functional features and Non-functional features.

第7回 Work place Design
General workplace layout, Dimensions, General Ergonomic principles of Laboratory, Microscope workstation, floors, Ramps and stairs, Computer workstation, Visual work dimensions, and How to apply anthropometric data.

第8回 User-Centered design
UCD methodology, Key aspects of UCD design and Iterative design cycle.

第9回 Usability & Website usability
Definition, Importance, How to make a usable systems, home problems in using website, and how to do website usability testing. 
Report: Modify your computer workstation according to Ergonomics Recommendations.

第10回 Basic Design Requirements
General design Requirements, Robust systems, Standardization, Human-machine systems and interaction.

第11回 3D Printing technology and Ergonomics
How to use 3D printing in evaluating ergonomic models. 
Report: Find some usability problems in your favorite website.

第12回 Equipment and tool Design
Design of controls and displays especially computer interface controls and make it self-explanatory. 
Report: Final project. Students has to develop an ergonomic design using the techniques they learnt. The design can be a product, a tool, a building, or a service. For those who chose to develop a product or a tool can use 3D printing techniques to make a prototype. Others can submit their design on papers using drawings.

第13回 Manual handling in Occupational task
Strategies to reduce manual handling, risk factors and guideline for designing lifting tasks and type of grip used, designing for special population

第14回 Final Project Presentation
Students will present their final project using PowerPoint.

その他
wrap-up and final project presentation.
