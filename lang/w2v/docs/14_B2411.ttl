Explore The World of English Grammar


Type:Grammar

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Extensive Reading,Grammar,Intensive Reading,Presentation,Web Activities,Chunking Grammar, Lexical Grammar, Learner Autonomy, Self-Assessment

Course Description:

This course is designed to help students learn grammar for communication. Not grammar for its own sake! To make this happen, Chunking Grammar and Lexical grammar will be introduced. Chunking Grammar is concerned with how to form chunks (information units) and how to combine them. Chunks are divided into three categories, which taken together comprise the world of English: nominal chunks corresponding to the world of things; verbal chunks representing the world of events; and adverbial chunks providing circumstantial information. Lexical Grammar explains grammatical structures, focusing on lexical items embedded there (e.g., Preposition to and to infinitive are the same in form, though different in function. Lexical grammar explains the relationship between the two). These new concepts of grammar will drastically change the way you understand and use the English language. In order to keep learner autonomy and motivation heightened, participants will select their own topics for their assignments and presentations.



Learning outcomes:

Those students who complete this course will have become able to:
1)   grasp the whole picture of the world of English grammar;
2) comprehend messages (mainly in the written mode) in English more clearly, with a heightened awareness of the correspondence between the linguistic form and its meaning;
3)   monitor (and repair) your own production of the target language when necessary;
4)   find topics for your own assignment and presentation.
And these will pave way for further autonomous learning on the part of the language user.



Teacher's comment:
Make as many mistakes as possible in class! For it is just natural to do so when using a second language. It’s also a proof that you’re trying to make progress in acquiring the target language. With this in mind, let’s start exploring the world of English grammar together!

Cross-cultural Communication
An Introduction to American Culture

Type:Writing/Presentation

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Intensive Reading,Presentation,Research,Speaking,Vocabulary,Web Activities,American History

Course Description:

There are many definitions of culture.  Some would define it as the art, literature, and music of a people, their architecture, history, religion, their traditions.  Some others might focus more on the customs and specific behavior of the people.  The course chooses a sociological definition of culture as the way of life of a group of people, developed over time and passed down from generation to generation.  This broad definition includes every aspect of human life and interaction.  The course is chosen to make a values approach focusing on the traditional mainstream values that have attracted people to the states.  The course traces how values affect aspects of life.



Learning outcomes:

By studying the information about the traditional, basic American values, where they came from, and how these values affect various institutions and aspects of life in the United States,  the course is intended to increase students' awareness and understanding of the cultural values of the United States, their own country, and other countries.  The information the students get in class will help them get a composite picture of American beliefs and practices as they relate to education, business, government, sports, recreation and so on.



Teacher's comment:
The real goal of this course is to help students become more sensitive to cultural differences and more accepting of them.  However, there will always be things about another culture that we do not like no matter how much we understand it.  The objective of this course is not to persuade others to approve of all facets of life in the United States but rather to help students understand it more fully and be able to adapt whenever it is desirable to do so.  There are opportunities for exploiting one's foreign qualities but there are also times when being from a different culture can be a real liability.  The instructor hopes that this introduction will help students make more informed choices.  (Important* If a student misses 4 classes, he or she will automatically fail the course.)

Reading English for Entertainment I
Louis Sachar's Holes (Low-Intermediate)

Type:Reading

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Extensive Reading,Literature,Vocabulary

Course Description:

I offer two "Reading English for Entertainment" classes. Both are Level A, but Reading English for Entertainment I (this class) is a little easier than Reading English for Entertainment II. Please choose based on your level.

Students will read Holes, a novel about a boy named Stanley who is innocent, but who is sent to a prison camp. The camp is called Camp Green Lake, but the lake has dried up and turned into a desert. He and the other "campers" have to dig holes all day. What are they looking for? What happened to the lake? How can Stanley prove his innocence?



Learning outcomes:

Students of this class will read large amounts of easy English text. This will...

Improve English reading speed
Reinforce existing vocabulary
Reinforce existing grammar knowledge
Aid in acquiring "nativelike" use of English (i.e. picking the words and phrases that make one sound "native")
Expose students to new words
Enable students to enjoy reading in English


Teacher's comment:
This class will push you to read more than you probably ever have in English, but because the level of the book will be appropriate to read comfortably, and because the story will be interesting (I hope!), you should be able to grow your English ability without even noticing!

The Power of Names
Reading: A Wizard of Earthsea

Type:Reading

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Extensive Reading,Intensive Reading,Presentation,Speaking

Course Description:

In this class we will discuss the book, A Wizard of Earthsea. Students will read each chapter before class, and bring written notes regarding points that were difficult to understand, so that everyone can discuss them together. These will be handed in as a part of the participation grade. Students will be responsible for keeping up with the pace of reading: if they miss a class, they are still responsible for handing in their notes for that chapter. Because the events of each chapter build on the events of previous chapters, discussions will not be confined to only the pages read that week. There will be some consolidation each week, but we will not be reading the book in class.

Discussion will cover mythic heroes and thems in stories from around the world and how the book shares some of these themes.  As a part of this course, students will create their own hero and myth.

This is an active participation class: students will need to join in the discussion every day for participation credit. Use of PCs or smartphones is not allowed unless specific permission is given. Paper and electronic dictionaries are allowed, but smartphone-based dictionaries are prohibited.



Learning outcomes:

After this class, You will be able to discuss the book, A Wizard of Earthsea, and heroes from various cultures. You will gain a deeper understanding of mythic literature, and its effect on, and importance to us as an audience.

This class is different from most writing courses because we will be looking at writing from a strongly communication-based perspective. Unlike more formal writing classes, our focus will be on using written English for interactions with others online, and do so in a way that is fun, informative, and useful. Because of that, the activities and projects in the course will be designed around your interests in writing in English.

Input Enhancement Through Song Lyrics


Type:Grammar

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Grammar,Listening,Presentation,Web Activities,Lexical Grammar, Learner Autonomy, Self-Assessment

Course Description:

In this course participants will listen to a number of cool songs in English. Artists to be introduced in class may include Taylor Swift, Linkin Park, Rihanna, and many others, classical and contemporary alike. The purpose of this course, however, is not just relax and enjoy listening to music; we will learn how to analyze the way grammatical items that appear in the lyrics of a certain song contribute to the message expressed in the song. Our main analytical tool is Lexical Grammar, which focuses on the relationships between grammatical structures and the semantics of the lexical items which are embedded therein. Participants will also select songs for their own assignment work on a weekly basis as well as for a presentation toward the end of the course.



Learning outcomes:

If you complete this course, you will have become better able to: 1) comprehend messages in English more clearly, with a heightened awareness of the correspondence between the linguistic form and its meaning; 2) find yourself more willing to analyze the linguistic forms of a song you come across; 3) feel happier about, and therefore, have a heightened motivation for learning the English language through listening to songs you like.



Teacher's comment:
If you like a song because the music is beautiful, that's wonderful. But do you understand the message of the song? If not, you might know less than half of the beauty of the song. Learning how to analyze grammatical items that appear in song lyrics will drastically change the way you appreciate the music you listen to. You can recommend your favorite songs to class, or other participants' recommendations might wake up your unknown tastes and interests. See you in class!

Listening to Respond


Type:Oral

Keyword:Discussion,Listening,Speaking,Pragmatics

Course Description:

This course is designed to focus on active listening in English by learning how to ask effective questions in a variety of listening contexts, including class discussions, small group conversations, and academic presentations. In particular, this course is aimed at developing skills to help learners identify key pieces of information from what they hear and form clear and specific questions to support their listening comprehension abilities. While presentations and discussions will be a part of the class, the focus for students will be on how learners respond to the content they hear and how they utilize the information they’ve been given to accomplish different tasks, such as making clarifications, challenging ideas, and even responding to questions raised by others.



Learning outcomes:

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

Identify main and supporting ideas raised by speakers in discussions, conversations, and academic presentations in English
Ask and identify questions designed to clarify or provide more information while listening to a speaker in English
Respond to questions by an audience clearly, honestly, and effectively
Self-assess strengths and areas of improvement regarding listening comprehension ability


Teacher's comment:
In this class we will talk as much as we listen, but our focus will be on using what we hear to make informed comments and questions. Every week we will discuss as a class different ideas related to being an active listener, and that requires that everyone participate in class and add to the conversation. From that, we should create a listening and discussion environment that is informal, relaxed, and fun.

Grammar through Rock and Pop Music
Cloze Exposed

Type:Oral

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Grammar,Listening,Speaking,Vocabulary,Rock and Pop Music, Rock and Pop Music Genres

Course Description:

This course is a combination grammar, listening and communication course suitable for students with a TOEFL score of up to 479, or students who have successfully completed the Gateway Course.  Students will be exposed to and given practice with various grammar points through cloze activities based on rock or pop music.  Vocabulary related to rock and pop music and genres will also be looked at through the course.  The grammar points will topics will be introduced through listening to rock or pop songs, and at the end of the course,  from tasks developed by the students themselves.

The course involves pair-work and small group-work to complete tasks, exercises and activities.

All homework, assignments and quizzes will be done online through Moodle.



Learning outcomes:

The primary objective of this course is to give students exposure to and practice with grammar points.  To this, vocabulary regarding the rock and pop music, and well as grammar terms will be introduced and practiced.  At the end of the course, students should feel more comfortable using the grammar forms introduced.  Other objectives include:

broadening understanding of rock/pop genres
developing a comfortable affiliation with English
This course is best suited for students who:

have TOEFL scores between 425 and 479
are comfortable taking instruction and participating in English
are happy to perform pair and group work
are keen to practice speaking skills
are looking to develop grammar and listening skills
In the first class students may be required to write a short essay.  During the essay, students will be called to conduct a short interview and asked a few questions to determine their English speaking proficiency.  Students can ask questions anytime during the first 90-minute class period.

Successful students must complete all assignments, in addition to regular participation both in-class and on-line to pass the course.  Students must pay attention to University attendance regulations in this class.



Teacher's comment:
Grammar is usually considered a fairly dry subject, but I plan to spice it up by developing understanding of the grammar point through listening to some good rock/pop songs.  On top of this, there will be discussion about genres of rock and pop music, and a comprehensive look at cloze.  I am sure you will find it interesting.

Gaining Sharper English Communication


Type:Oral

Keyword:Culture,Listening,Presentation,Speaking

Course Description:

The first unit is for introduction and preparation.  Each subsequent unit begins and ends with a presentation in order to demonstrate the students’ progress, both to the instructor and to the students themselves.  These will be delivered solo, on assigned topics with approximately a minute allowed for preparation.  Following the initial presentation, there will be a brief intro followed by exercises and role plays. The role plays will be geared to provide the student with the opportunity of using some part of the skill set in a focused way.  Each unit will be organized to gradually expand on the skills involved, in preparation for the exams.
 
Prior to the Midterm and the Final, there will be a consolidation practice day to give the students another opportunity to apply the skills in an integrated way.  Any remaining time may be used to begin preparation for the exam.



Learning outcomes:

After this class, you will be able to express yourself in a fun, clear, and concise manner.  You will also be able to effectively state when you don’t understand and request more information as needed.
