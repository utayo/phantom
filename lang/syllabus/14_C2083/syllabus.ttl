	sylb:summary "It becomes possible to access a huge amount of diverse data through the Internt. It allows us to obtain new knowledge and create new	services, leading to an innovation called "Big Data" or "Collective Intelligence". In order to understand such data and use it as a tool, one needs to have a good understanding of the technical background in statistics, machine learning, and computer network systems.

In this class, you will learn about the overview of large-scale data analysis on the Internet, and basic skills to obtain new knowledge from massive information for the forthcoming information society.

";
	sylb:method "In this class, you will learn about data collection and data analysis methods on the Internet, to obtain knowledge and understanding of networking technologies and large-scale data analysis.

Each class will provide specific topics where you will learn the technologies and the theories behind the technologies. In addition to the lectures, each class includes programming exercises to obtain data analysis skills through the exercises.
