Discovering the 'Other' Africa

Type:Project

Keyword:Discussion,Intensive Reading,Presentation,Project

Course Description:

Much of our knowledge about Africa is often the usual or the same misplaced concept of poverty and danger. Many of the few who dare, however, to set foot in the continent return with an exciting view of joy and incredible realities. The aim of this project course is to offer students the opportunity of looking at Africa in another way and discovering its real potential. The language components of the course are reading, presentation and discussion.



Learning outcomes:

Topics and weekly activities for this class are designed in a way that challenges students to think critically of what they hear about Africa. At the end of the term, students will have the necessary foundation to talk 'Africa' with a greater sense of objectivity.



Teacher's comment:
The class is rigorous, fun and rewarding. Students also have the opportunity to connect the issues discussed in the course to their individual academic interest; all this while working on their personal language needs.

Type:Composition

Keyword:Academic English,Discussion,Intensive Reading,Research,Web Activities,Writing

Course Description:

This class is designed to provide students with the opportunity to experience the intellectual challenges and satisfactions of writing an argumentative research paper on a topic of their choice in the field of EFL (or in other fields).Students choose a controversial issue on a subject area, for instance, English education (e.g. Should English be taught at elementary schools?) and present/defend their point of view using the information gathered. Through this semester-long project, students become accustomed to the process of writing a research paper: Reviewing the techniques/rules necessary for academic writing (e.g. paragraph/essay development), using the library and the Internet to get necessary information, conducting a questionnaire /interview to support their position on the issue, and weaving the work of others into their own research paper in the APA style. At the end of this semester, students must submit a final paper (more than 5 typed pages). In this class, students interact a great deal with one another, so active participation in pair/group work is essential.



Learning outcomes:

By the end of this semester, (1) students will acquire basic steps to writing an argumentative research paper, often a common requirement of many academic courses in English-speaking colleges/universities, (2) they will be familiar with the most frequently used format of references, APA, and (3) they will be aware of cross-cultural issues such as plagiarism.

Teacher's comment:
This class is good for those (1) who are interested in foreign language education / acquisition (2) who want to prepare for academic classes at English-speaking colleges / universities and (3) who have NEVER taken this class before.

You may be asked to pay 1,000 yen (or less) for using Criterion, an online essay evaluation system in order to brush up on your basic writing skills.

	sylb:method "The Best Minds of a Generation: The Beats


Type:Reading

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Film,Intensive Reading,Listening,Literature,Presentation,Project,Research,Web Activities

Course Description:

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz...
—from “Howl” by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg

After the US emerged as the last man standing from the global nightmare that was the Second World War, a new social order developed. Veterans—young men who were born during Prohibition, grew up in the Great Depression, and then endured the horrors of WWII before they were even adults—were desperate to “return” to an idealized version of “normal.” The rise of the Soviet Union resulted in communist witch hunts that further encouraged Americans to conform to this ideal—a situation that hid continuing problems of racial and social inequality, and which actively oppressed those who did not meet these expectations. Against this backdrop, a group of poets and novelists, referring to themselves as the Beat Generation, rose up against this smothering personal and cultural suppression to assert their own identities. Although the many writers and writings of the Beat Generation reflect a wide array of styles, subjects, and viewpoints, they share a central ideal of personal freedom and the rejection of false social norms—an ideal which came to define the latter half of the 1900s, and whose influence can still be very much felt today. In this course we will read and discuss these influential writers’ works, as well as the profound effects they had on the American—and international—mental landscape. We will read excerpts of their works and examine their impacts on literature, music, religion, and sexuality.



Learning outcomes:

In this course we will read these influential writers’ works and view several films devoted to them in order to discuss, the profound effects they had on the American—and international—mental landscape.



Teacher's comment:
This course is very similar to a literature course in a Western university. You will read at home, prepare topics for discussion, and then in class we will discuss the readings and the themes in the readings. The material may challenge you, both with the level of language and with the content. Please come with an open mind, and I think you will have a very interesting semester.

Introduction
The postwar era, the writers, and "What is Beat?"

第2回 #2
Film: Kill Your Darlings (2013)
A film starring Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg, telling the story of the beginnings of the Beat Movement, from his dorm room at Columbia.

第3回 #3
Discussion: Allen Ginsberg's "Howl"
The subject of a long and highly-publicized obscenity trial, Allen Ginsberg's poem, with its frenetic style and raw content encapsulates the Beat ethos, and serves as a great jumping-off-point into reading the Beats.

第4回 #4
Discussion: Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" (cont.)

第5回 #5
Lecture: Sexuality and the Beats
Of the three main Beat writers (Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Burroughs), two were openly homosexual and the other was occasionally bisexual, at a time in American history when such identities were not publicly acknowledged. This frankness eventually influenced the hippies and the Sexual Revolution.

第6回 #6
Discussion: Jack Kerouac's On the Road (excerpt)
Detailing 7 years of traveling back and forth across the United States with Beat wild-boy-hero Neal Cassady, this is the movement's most famous novel from its most famous writer. It not only recounts the tales of the trip, but tells the story of the people they met on their journeys, and the thoughts and epiphanies they brought about.

第7回 #7
Discussion: Jack Kerouac's On the Road (excerpt) (cont.)

第8回 #8
Lecture: Bebop Jazz
Bebop jazz was the musical movement closely associated with and idolized by the Beats. Artists like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and John Coltrane rejected the newly-genteel conventions of swing jazz and replaced them with passionate improvisation, creating a sound and an energy that the Beats tried to incorporate into their writing.

第9回 #9
Discussion: William S. Burroughs Junky (excerpt)
A "junkie" (as we spell it today) is a heroin addict. William S. Burroughs spent much of his life as a heroin-addicted petty criminal, and the central theme of much of his writing is that of the dehumanizing effect of drug addiction. Junky, like most of the Beat writings, is semi-autobiographical, and relates stories from Burroughs' time as a small-time drug dealer and hustler in the underbelly of 1950s New York City.

第10回 #10
Discussion: William S. Burroughs Junky (excerpt) (cont.)

第11回 #11
Discussion: William S. Burroughs' Media
Although primarily a writer, later in Burroughs' career, he experimented with audio and video recordings, and released a number of albums. Although not strictly literature, a discussion of Burroughs would be incomplete without experiencing these.

	sylb:method "So What? Developing Critical Presentation Skills


Type:Writing/Presentation

Keyword:Discussion,Presentation,Speaking,Critical Thinking

Course Description:

What is oftentimes overlooked in presentations is an answer to the question “So what?”. This class is all about delivering presentations that have a strong message—whether it is challenging old ways of thinking, raising new ideas, or building awareness of current issues—and working towards delivering that message in a way that is more than just informative, but matched to the uses and interests of the audience. Learners in this class will look at ways to integrate critical thinking into their presentations such that they are not only presenting information, but building an argument and challenging their audience to think differently. This class will integrate several small group presentations and peer-feedback approaches to help students gain confidence speaking in front of others in English, and do so in a way that is clear, concise, and memorable.



Learning outcomes:

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

Critically analyze, argue, and defend ideas and issues in English for formal academic presentation settings
Deliver information in English in a purposeful, organized, and clear way that shows an awareness of the topic, arguments, and audience
Use body language and intonation effectively to aid in conveying ideas, stating facts, and emphasizing opinions
Self-assess their strengths for organizing and delivering presentations in English, and identify areas for continued development


Teacher's comment:
This class is designed around building critical thinking skills through language, and while we will focus on how to use these skills for English presentations, much of what we will discuss and do in the class will be useful in many different areas of your future career, no matter what language you use. Presentations and activities will therefore be designed around student-selected topics and interests.

Songs that you are (hopefully) unfamiliar with will be explored and it is hoped that both English language ability (listening, speaking, reading, writing, grammar) as well as appreciation of new artists and musical genres will grow as a result.

Students will watch documentary films, as well as films with strong musical content / connections that examine the power of music and the lives of musicians.

Students will also watch films that have strong connection to music (biographic films about the music industry, musicals, films that are connected to music through their soundtracks or storylines, etc.), and do related language and culture based activities.

 

 



Learning outcomes:

This course will give students the opportunity to practice all language skills and to share ideas.

Listening and Vocabulary building (with special emphasis on metaphorical and poet usage) will be highlighted.

 



Teacher's comment:
This syllabus page will be updated over the course of the semester as the course ebbs and flows.

Course Description:

Students develop language techniques in preparation for professional situations.  The course is made up of: listening exercises, presentation workshops and seminars, discussions and debates.  This is primarily a discussion-based class and students are encouraged to develop he capacity to think critically and to eveluate objectively.  We have many open class discussions and group presentations.  Students are required to form their opinions about the presentation arguments, and to contribute in a diplomatic and logical manner during Q & A session, through Moodle and during feedback seminars.  These scenarios mirror the workplace and are therefore useful for students who are comfortable participating in class in English and are considering using English in their future careers.

Students will be expected to:

Actively engage with presentations
Evaluate recordings and texts from authentic sources
Respond to selected readings on current/historical issues (societal, environmental etc.)
Participate in group discussions and deliver presentations
Students pass the course when they successfully complete all assigned course work. Attendance, classroom participation, completed assignments, and group presentations all contribute to the calculation of the final grade. Students are reminded to pay particular attention to university attendance regulations. PLEASE NOTE. Class Interaction via Moodle use is a mandatory course requirement and will be assessed in relation to the final grade. Plagiarism is unacceptable.

 



Learning outcomes:

This course will focus on developing and practicing strategies for understanding and forming more accurate interpretations of interactions in spoken English commonly encountered in a variety of academic, professional and public situations. 

Additional objectives include:

Developing opinions and expressig them
Applying and understanding patterns of natural English speech
Speaking English for increased comprehension
Critically eveluating presentations
Forming logical arguments for discussion


Teacher's comment:
Student participation is most important. This class can be very stimulating.

Course Description:

"As long as this school of ours stands, Japan remains a civilized nation of the world."  chpt. X;  Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa. 

What is Japan? NHK has a program, Begin Japanology (with a youtube channel) 
http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/tv/japanology/  that "explores many aspects of Japan." But NHK also has "Cool Japan" http://www6.nhk.or.jp/cooljapan/en/ (title misappropriated from an important essay which we will read)  that attempts to "discover what makes Japan cool, and examines the appeal and secrets of these cool cultural aspects that Japanese take for granted are being accepted as cool and trendy by foreigners." So what is Japan? This course will examine Japan Studies (sometimes Japanology in Europe) to explore fields such as the study of Japanese language, culture, history, literature, art, music, and science. Based on the research and class presentations, the students will create a web portal to introduce their own aspects of Japan to global students at SFC, and participate in the WikiProject Japan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Japan



Learning outcomes:

Through selected readings and discussions, students will investigate some of the basic cultural studies issues such as  Who defines culture and why? what are cultural frames and identities? are cultural identities and geopolitcal boundries congruent?  Language Acquisition skills: vocabulary, classroom fluency
Based on the research and discussions, the students will make three formal presentations on Japan studies research. Language acquisition skills: the basics of english rhetoric oral and written.
Through the presentations, the class will develop a collaborative plan for developing the  Keio SFC Japan Portal


Teacher's comment:
As this is a language project class, the most important component is daily attendance and  PARTICIPATION.  This means being in class, on time, using YOUR English to communicate. “Being in class, on time,” means just that.  If you need to miss a class whether through illness, school activities, or personal business, please send an appropriate e-mail (before, not after that fact) and keep up with the work. at 5 absences, you will not pass. Daily participation means using English everyday in class.  It does not mean speaking perfectly, it does not mean having the “correct” answer to every question (a good question, for example, “What does that word mean?” is as much participation as a good answer;) It does mean using your English as a daily communication tool! No speaking = no grade.

Students participating in this course will get an overview of Japanese culture and society (traditional performing arts, tea ceremony, haiku, World Heritage Washoku, pop culture, the Japanese family, customs, and manners, etc.), and the history (6th century-Present) of Japan through instruction at Uji-city cultural centers in Kyoto, Japan. Japan is a very safe country, and especially, Kyoto, where students will stay most of the time with their host family in the most beautiful ancient capital. Participants will get an opportunity to expand their Japanese language skills and social skills through interaction with their host family, instructors, and other Japanese people in Japan. Students can experientially deepen their understanding of various Japanese cultures through hands-on workshops for a tea ceremony and zen, and excursions to historically significant sites and Japanese companies not only in Kyoto, Uji, and Nara (Kansai regions, West of Japan), but also in Tohoku and Tokyo in the East.

Cultural Studies

. 

Vision is crucial in identifying ingredients, their quality, and the techniques used, and even has a bearing on the perception of flavor. A dish not displayed traditionally may "not taste the same," and an unfamiliar color, such as blue, may be off-putting. Japanese diners recognize the importance of eye appeal, to the extent of photographing their meals at restaurants around the world. Their cooks display fanned slices, neat parcels,  sculpted vegetables, and noodles placed in soups. Cut fish displayed without sauces contributes to a clean look. According to Richard Hosking in A Dictionary of Japanese Food, chefs might "spend the day considering the aesthetics of arranging three sardines."

Moritsuke (food arrangement) follows seven basic patterns, including sugimori (strips and slices of food in a slanting pile), kasanemori (overlapping slices), tawaramori (blocks or rounds placed horizontally in a pyramid), and so on. Illustrating invention within a highly regulated framework, the shojin ryori cookery tradition arranges food like a seasonal landscape—perhaps blue mountains in summer, red in autumn, brown in winter, and flowery in spring. The resulting scene is so abstract that it may appear as one or two objects on a plate to the untutored eye.  As Japanese cooks and diners also appreciate, food is framed by the plate, which might be a beautiful object in its o

Presentation 2: tools of analysis

How do we present ideas (rather than information) and PERSUADE the audience to listen?

Information is the same everywhere - it consists of facts, research, data; when we want to present our findings we need to think again about rhetoric. As we have seen, English rhetoric goes back to Aristotle, and so does its analytical basis - logic. 

Aristotle was wanted his students not only to be good speakers, but to be able of building a strong argument (logos) and recognizing a "false" argument. So he wrote another book called - Logic. 

Logic like rhetoric is culturally based, so to present well in english we need to understand the basis of english logical structure.  The key concept is "linear development," this means we develop one clear idea through a series of "logical" steps (example: A=B, B=C therefore A=C.) These steps are referred to as an Aristotelean Syllogism ( it means a logical argument.)  This structure is implicit in almost every persuasive presentation in English. Although Aristotle "invented" the syllogism it was a Roman lawyer named Cicero who applied it to making a formal presentation. He was famous for his brilliant court speeches; in fact he was so famous that even today students in English-speaking cultures memorize his oration (new word -look it up!) in the case against Cataline, a man who was plotting to overthrow the government. (We can still see high school students wrapped in there old bed sheets giving this speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLFu45VifuY)

Cicero wrote a book about how to make the best court case and his concept is called - inventio (what english word is related to this latin root?) He said that the order in which we present our argument is as important as our information. Here is the order as we use it today:

I. Introduction - the topic and the thesis statement with a concluding sentence that stresses WHY this argument is important to the audience.

II. Summary - the basic and BRIEF factual information that the audience will need in order to follow your argument.

III. The Body of the Evidence - the key findings you have made with concrete examples to illustrate each separate finding.

IV. Contra - the answers to the arguments against your idea. This is usually supported by background (non-original) research i.e. other people's ideas and information that support your position.

V. Conclusion - restate your main concept. 

when we look at this structure - ONE idea, defined, supported, researched and restated, we see the basic structure of English presentations.  You may notice that this argumentation structure is similar to the structure of the 5 paragraph essay.  This is because this is how students in English speaking cultures learn how to order information and their ideas clearly and persuasively in both written and oral presentations. These five steps of analysis let us present our information in English in a way our audience can easily follow and thus be persuaded by OUR ideas.  

Here is a typical persuasive writing and speaking (i.e. rhetoric) page for a high school in Montana:

http://www.hhs.helena.k12.mt.us/Teacherlinks/Oconnorj/persuasion.html

Can you identify - 

a reference to Aristotle/Cicero and the ancient roots of rhetoric?

a guide to ordering the argument (first, second etc.)

a reference to types of evidence ( remember Aristotle's three ideas.)

fieldwork research and report

When you are planning to carry out interviews as part of a research project, the first things to consider are who you will interview, what kind of information you want to obtain, and the type of interview that will help you to do that.

Unstructured interview. The interviewer uses at most an 'aide memoir' - notes to jog the memory - rather than a list of questions. The interview may be like a conversation, with the interviewer responding to the interviewee and letting them speak freely.

Semi-structured interview. The interviewer has a list of questions or key points to be covered and works through them in a methodical manner. Similar questions are asked of each interviewee, although supplementary questions can be asked as appropriate. The interviewee can respond how they like and does not have to 'tick a box' with their answer.

Structured interview. The interviewer asks the interviewee a series of specific questions, to which a fixed range of answers are possible ('ticking a box'). This is the typical form of interview used in social survey research, and can provide quantitative data, as in a questionnaire.

Preparing an interview guide -  When preparing an interview guide you need to keep in mind the following points.

Make sure you introduce yourself and explain the aim of the interview. Also adhere to academic ethics by making sure the interviewee is fully aware of the purpose of the research

Devise your questions so they help to answer your research question, and make sure all the questions are relevant

Try and have a sequence to your questions or topics by grouping them in themes that follow a logical sequence

That said, make sure that you can easily move back and forth between questions or topic areas, as your interviewee may naturally move on to another subject

Make sure your questions are clear and easy to understand - only use technical or academic language if you are sure your interviewee will understand what you mean

Do not ask leading questions. Make sure people are free to give their own, honest answers.

Kinds of question

Introducing questions: 'Why did you...?' or 'Can you tell me about...?' Through these questions you introduce the topic.

Follow up questions: Through these you can elaborate on their initial answer. Questions may include: 'What did you mean...?' or 'Can you give more detail...?'

Probing questions: You can employ direct questioning to follow up what has been said and to get more detail. 'Do you have any examples?' or 'Could you say more about...?'

Specifying questions: Such as 'What happened when you said that?' or 'What did he say next?'

Direct questions: Questions with a yes or no answer are direct questions. You might want to leave these questions until the end so you don't lead the interviewee to answer a certain way.

Indirect questions: You can ask these to get the interviewee's true opinion.

Structuring questions: These move the interview on to the next subject. For example, 'Moving on to...'

Silence: Through pauses you can suggest to the interviewee that you want them to answer the question!

Interpreting questions: 'Do you mean that...?' or 'Is it correct that...?' 

To create a grammatically correct question in English we need to use the Interrogative mode (or mood;) one of the four basic sentence patterns of written English: http://www.grammar.com/interrogative-mood/ 

Here is a table that can help us understand the interrogative mode of English:

Type:Composition

Keyword:Culture,Film,Liguistics,Presentation,Project,Vocabulary,Web Activities

Course Description:

This course is firmly based on the idea that language is a powerful reflection of cultural values, and therefore uses translation as a means to explore the workings and characteristics of our own language as well as those of English. Making use of subtitled/dubbed movies and TV shows as material, we will work on both Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translations. In every class, we will challenge ourselves with the task of creating our own "sub-channel" scripts or subtitles. It is an activity-based course in which students are expected to learn from practical experience and experimentation, creativity imagination and humor will be highly appreciated. We will also be working towards a common goal- producing a dubbed ("fukikae") English version of a segment from a Japanese video of your choice in groups. In the beginning of the course we will work on English-language videos translating the subtitles or dubbed versions and "re-creating" the English scripts. After writing Japanese subtitles and dub scripts using English videos for a few weeks, we finally move on to using Japanese materials in order to create the English versions. In class we will use short video segments and work on translation in pairs or groups. Class activities will basically follow the same procedure every week:

Watching the video segment
Translating and discussing in pairs or groups
Presenting the script sharing each other's work
Comparing our versions with the original version
Discussing the work and material

Teacher's comment:
The work we do in this course has always been a valuable learning experience not only for my students but also for myself. It's amazing how much we learn about the two languages we are familiar with through the creative process of translation. The project videos presented by the students every semester are well-produced and very entertaining. I warmly invite you to join us in our exploration of language and culture. Looking forward to seeing many of you in class! (Students who have already taken this course are advised NOT to enroll again.)

To GIGA students: Since we are dealing with both English and Japanese scripts, having a good knowledge of written Japanese (vocabulary and kanji) would be beneficial. However, those who are eager to develop their Japanese skills through the work are also welcome.
