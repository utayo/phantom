	sylb:summary "Ecology is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms to each other and their surroundings. Landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across the natural sciences and social sciences. Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by various interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings. You will learn the fundamental theories and methods of landscape ecology, and the application to nature conservation and restoration.

Please wear good shoes and long pants. There is an excursion on a Saturday. I will inform students the day of excursion and location at the first class.

	sylb:schedule "第1回 What is landscape ecology?
This is a guidance of landscape ecology. Students learn what landscape ecology is, and the aim and goal of this lecture. Especially, we focus on the word “landscape”.

第2回 Special lecture 1
Special lecture about landscape ecology and culture.

第3回 Basis of ecology
Landscape ecology has been developed based on ecology and geography. you learn basic theory of ecology, ex. ecosystem, food web, population and community.

第4回 Insular biogeography
Insular biogeography had been developed from the end of 19 century to the middle of 20 century. Many researchers had investigated the number of species on islands and tried to find the theory how the number is detected.

第5回 Population and community ecology
Students learn the basis population and community, ex. growth of population, competition, coexistence, niche, symbiosis, ecotone and species richness.

第6回 Vegetation ecology and plant sociology
We can find different plant species between the north and south part of Japan. What are important factors to determine the distribution of plant species? Also, students learn plant sociology, which has been developed mainly in Europe.

第7回 Conservation biology
After the World War II we have realized the loss of species richness all of the world due to many kinds of human impact. The huge number of ecologists had aimed to look for key factors for species conservation. Students learn the theories of conservation biology and meaning of biodiversity.

第8回 Midterm exam and landscape ecology (28 November 2016)
There is a midterm exam on the first half of class. Then, there is a lecture and no fieldwork on the day. Landscape ecology has separately been developed in the northern America and Europe. At first, you learn American landscape ecology. You have to understand patch, corridor, matrix and ecological network.

第9回 Biotope conservation and plan
Landscape ecology has been developed based on plant sociology in Germany. Students learn the concept of biotope conservation and plan. Also, students learn biotope survey and mapping, which is a monitoring method for some sorts of spacial planning.

第10回 Landscape change and sustainable development
Landscape is changing every moment due to natural process or human impacts. If we monitor process of landscape change in an area, we can define how a factor effects the landscape. The monitoring give us much information for sustainable development in the future. In the end of this lecture I show a final task.

第11回 Special lecture
There is a special lecture. The day will be informed at the first class.

第12回 Excursion 1
The day and location of excursion will be informed at the first class.

第13回 Excursion 2
The excursion will be conducted with the excursion 1.

第14回 Final exam and discussion
There is a final exam.

その他
Discussion and fieldwork.
