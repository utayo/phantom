	sylb:summary "This is an international finance course for undergraduate students. We will cover the monetary or macroeconomic side of international economics, such as the determinants of the exchange rate and the effects of monetary policy. The first half of the course will be devoted to the exchange rate and open-economy macroeconomics. In particular, we will learn how the exchange rate is determined. Then, in the last half, we will look at international macroeconomic policy as well as exchange rate policies in developed and developing countries. We will study how policies work, and what kind of policy is desirable.

	sylb:method "Learning Outcomes:

Students will be able to explain how exchange rates are determined based on a variety of models. In particular, they will be able to differentiate long-run and short-run models. Factors that affect exchange rates will be categorized in real shock and nominal (monetary) shocks. After learning the relationship between the exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables, including output or net exports, students will be able to apply models used in class to real economic problems and policy debates such as external imbalances and high national debts.
