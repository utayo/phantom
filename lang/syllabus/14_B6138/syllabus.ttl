	sylb:summary "In this class, we look into various software systems including Operating System, electric mail system, Web system, text format system, Java virtual machine and database management system.

";
	sylb:method "Various software systems are used in the current computer system. The most fundamental software system is Operating system. Every computer has its operating system and it allows other software to operate on the computer. On top of the operating system, there are several important middle ware software systems. We pick up some of the software systems which we use in our daily computer use and look into their functions and mechanisms.

";
	sylb:schedule "第1回 Operating System
The most fundamental software is the operating system. Every computer has its operating system. We study functions of operating system.

第2回 File System
One of the function the operating system provides is the file system. We will compare functions of various file systems and look into one implementation of file system.

第3回 Shell
Shell is the interface program to the operating system. It has been developed for UNIX operating system. We will investigate what the shell does and how.

第4回 Text Format System
In order to print documents beautifully, we need a text format system. TeX is one of the famous text format systems. We see how TeX formats text.

第5回 C Compiler
C programming language is one of the most popular programming languages. We see its compiler and understand how high level programming language programs are converted into machine language programs.

第6回 LISP
In artificial intelligence, LISP is often used as its programming language. LISP is preferred for symbolic processing. We look into its interpreter system.

第7回 Java Virtual Machine
Java is an object oriented programming language. Its unique feature is that programs are compiled into virtual instructions which run on Java Virtual Machine. We will see the mechanism of Java Virtual Machine.

第8回 Network System
Various software systems use network. We will study the basic of network system provided by the operating system. We will also see server client model which is often used to implement current network systems.

第9回 Name Resolution
Domain Name System is used to resolve host names to IP adresses.

第10回 Electric Mail System
Electric mail system is the most popular network system used now. It consists of several components. We will study those components and the network protocols they use.

第11回 Distributed File System
We will study the mechanism of sharing files across network.

第12回 World Wide Web
World Wide Web is also the most popular network system we use now. We will look into its protocol for transferring information across network.

第13回 Window System
As an example of Window system, we will study X Window System developed by MIT.

第14回 Dtabase Management System
We will study the inside of database management system.

その他
We will have discussion on future software system.
