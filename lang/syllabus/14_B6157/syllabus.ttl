	sylb:summary "The course will cover mathematical modeling techniques for simulating the behavior of biological systems at the sub-cellular level. Particular focus will be given to modeling various molecular and cellular processes. (i.e. enzyme reaction, population dynamics of bacteria, signal transduction in the cell, electrophysiological dynamics of ion channels, etc.) Topics include methods for mathematical modeling and computer simulation, design of simulation experiments, and analysis of results. Students will be expected to learn about:

Fundamentals of differential equation system.
Mathematical modeling of biological problems, and computer simulation of the model,
Visualization and interpretation of simulation results.
";
	sylb:method "Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
Apply basic programming skills for biosimulation,

Explain the foundations for concepts and equations on dynamical biosystems,

Implement simple mathematic model using simulation softwares.

For many students of the class is their first formal introduction to biological modeling and simulation. Therefore the course aims not only to have students learn the practical simulation skills but also to see its mathematical concepts.
