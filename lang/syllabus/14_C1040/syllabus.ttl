	sylb:summary "Japan’s Population has been decreasing affected by declining birth rate and aging population. Declining birth rate has been accelerating population aging, but the increase of aged people and deaths is defined by the demographic transition that occurred 60 to 80 years ago. The change of population structure leads the change of the basic condition of family formation. Late marriage that is a cause of declining birth rate affects household structure. In addition to this, internal migration brought about the different types of population and family structure leading different types of issues in each region. This course deals with the basic concepts and methods to analyze fertility, mortality, population structure, migration/distribution, and family/household and helps students to understand the mechanisms of population dynamics.

　少子高齢化、人口減少が進む我が国の年齢構造は、ほとんど過去の出生と死亡の履歴によって規定されている｡ なかでも80～60年前に起きた「人口転換」の影響は大きく､今日の高齢者の増大と死亡の増加を決定づけている。また少子化と呼ばれる出生率の低下は､ 現在進行中の高齢化を加速させるものであるが､ より深刻な影響はさらに遠い将来に訪れる｡ 高齢化も含めた年齢構造の変化は､ 家族形成の基底的条件を変化させ､ 少子化の背景にある晩婚化・非婚化とあいまって、家族構造を大きく変化させる｡ これに人口移動が加わって､ 地域別に異なった人口・家族構造とそれに起因する問題群を現出させることになる｡ 本講義では､ 出生､ 死亡､ 年齢構造､ 人口移動と人口分布､ 世帯と家族などを分析するための基本的概念や方法を学び､ 人口変動のメカニズムに対する認識を深める。
