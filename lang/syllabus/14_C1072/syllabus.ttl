	sylb:summary "This class focuses on public policy process. A goal of a public policy is to heighten welfare of people, but their ways vary among laws, subsidies, guidances, regulations and others. How good and bad policies are formulated in legislative and executive branches? Those processes are functions of political institutions, leaders, pressure groups, interests, media reports and many other factors. This class will discuss policy processes mainly in Japan and the U.S. while referring to other countries for comparison.

	sylb:method "The goal of this class is to have a better view of public policy processes. It is sometimes easy to blame political leaders in scandals, but why those things happen? Is it a problem of institutions or processes? Classical political science theories focused on institutions, but in 1960s political scientists started looking at processes. Since then, many theories have been accumulated. 

Every week we divide 90 minutes into three sections: (1) political process in news, (2) political process in theory, and (3) political process in history. In "political process in news" we pick up news in each week related to policy process and discuss findings. In "political process in theory" we study existing theories in this field in textbooks. In "political process in history" we examine past cases of interesting issues.
