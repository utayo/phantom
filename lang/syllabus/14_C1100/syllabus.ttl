	sylb:summary "This workshop walks you through the complex network of policy issues, which gives the impression at once of Asia as a divided region and of Asia as a uniquely harmonious region. To capture Asia as such, the workshop also offers an idea of how to go about examining it. The workshop connects Keio University and Kyoto University through a distant conferencing system. By connecting the two campuses, the workshop enriches the human resources to be exploited for offering more diverse lectures on various issues in Asia. This year, the responsibility for selecting the topics and lectures goes to Kyoto University. This is also a "workshop," meaning that the lectures are meant to stimulate your interests in Asia and to give a broader perspective for your interests. This year, the course consists of three major parts: one, the ways (some of which are unusual) by which to capture “Asia,”; two, the examination of the Asian theater where "democratization" is going through its new phase; and three, the observation of Asian "life" under the pressures of global warming and other fundamental changes in its environment. Given the nature of the topics, we invite not only academics as speakers but also the practitioners of many stripes. (Having practitioners as guest speakers makes the scheduling a somewhat haphazard chore, and therefore we also would like to ask your tolerance to possible last-minute changes in the invited speakers (and topics).

第8回 Interim Discussion: Give us ideas as to where your thinking is（担当：Vu Le Thao Chi）
We'll introduce some of the ideas of the students who have wet their appetite for more after a half of the semester. We ask 2 to 3 students from each of Keio and Kyoto to tell us what they plan to submit as the final product (assignment) for the workshop.

第9回 Asian Theatre in Cross-Border Problems 2: specifics TBA（担当：TBA）
Part of Global warming problems, we call attention to the worsening problem of de-forestation

第10回 Asian Theatre in Cross-Border Problems 3: specifics TBA（担当：TBA）
We have macro-level problems that we can capture at a macro-level observation

第11回 Asian Theatre in Cross-Border Problems 4: specifics TBA（担当：TBA）
Is Islamic economy peripheral to or an integral part of Asia?

第12回 Cases 1: specifics TBA（担当：TBA）
As Asian economy has been undergoing radial and fundamental changes, the necessity has become even more acute to capture how these changes have effects on the fundamental units of life: family and gender relationship.

第13回 Cases 3: specifics TBA（担当：TBA）
Pandemics are both medical and epidemic (reads -- human relationship) issues. Asia has been known both to host some of serious pandemics and to contain and solve them.

第14回 A wrap-up session（担当：Umegaki）
We will ask a few of the students to exhibit their final products (the products ready for the final finishing touch.)

その他
Given the system -- a distant-conferencing system -- to manage the workshop, we'll introduce an online course management system as the semester begins
