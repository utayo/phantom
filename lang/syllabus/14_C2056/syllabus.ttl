	sylb:summary "This course explores the world of lexicon in English. A lexicon is, by definition, a set of words. Each of us has acquired lexical competence to talk about the world. What is lexical competence? How do children come by lexical competence? How is the meaning of a word captured linguistically? These are some of the questions we address in this course. For the purpose of semantic analysis, we deal with corporate slogans, songs, poems, speeches, and other authentic materials. The main objective of this course is to raise our awareness about the power of words in such a way as to be able to use words more fully and aptly. You will enjoy the course with a full understanding that a word is a microcosm of human consciouness.

この授業では英語の語彙の世界を探索します。映画、音楽、演説、小説など実際の英語を題材にして語彙意味論的な観点から作品世界の魅力に迫ります。

	sylb:method "This course consists of lectures, groups discussions, and presentations. Thematically, it will deal with a variety of aspects of English lexicon including prepositions, verbs, and idiomatic expressions. Each lecture highlights one of the main characteristics of English linguistically and stylistically. In dealing with prepositions, for example, we will demonstrate that English is a prepositional language, thus emphasizing spatial ways of describing events. The lecture discusses the theory of prepositions. Then, the group discussion session follows: on the basis of authentic texts, each group of five or six discusses how prepositions work. Finally, each group is encouraged to make a group presentation in class. Emphasis is placed on theory, analysis, and application in second language teaching.
