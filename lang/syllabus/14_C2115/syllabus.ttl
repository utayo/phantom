	sylb:summary "An overview of human computer interaction and problems of current interest. Topics include: history of HCI, human factors, designing HCI experiments. As a practice in this class, it is required to develop your own prototype of PUI(perceptual UI) / TUI(tangible UI) system, and demonstrate it for a user experiment at the finale.
