	sylb:summary "This class introduces students to the basic knowledge and practices of interaction design.

First, students can learn a interaction design process that includes design research, idea & concept making, prototype making and refinement.

Second, this class focuses on the field of Computer Human Interaction (CHI). Students learn a history of CHI, advanced research stream in this field (Diplay, Physical computing, Programmable Matter etc.).

Third, students work to design original interactive media for supporting our daily lives.
