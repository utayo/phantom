	sylb:summary "Cognitive science is aiming to explore humans by integrating psychology, linguistics, artificial intelligence and brain science. In the first half of the term, the following basic topics are explained such as memory and knowledge, thinking and inference, language cognition, visual and auditory cognition, and emotion cognition. Experiments of cognitive science provides numerical and language data. Such data are affected from complex functions of the human brain and individual variation. Data processing methods and analysis methods are explained by introducing the past major cognitive experiments. In the second half of the term, the course includes experiments of the human sensory memory and the short-term memory, international comparison of the relation between color cognition and emotion, and data mining. As an example of the data mining, text mining from a large scale language data in SNS is used for the experience in this term.

	sylb:method "Cognitive science is aiming to explore humans by integrating linguistics, psychology, information science and artificial intelligence. Human functions are explored by various experiments. Human responses in the experiments are sometimes ambiguous and include individual differences, so that the experiments should be designed effectively and the data be analyzed carefully. This course provides the following topics, memory and knowledge, thinking and inference, language cognition, visual and auditory cognition, emotion cognition and conceptual structure. In the cognitive science experiments of the topics, methods to process the data such as percentage of correct answers and response time are shown. Text mining methods are also provided which are useful to extract valuable information from large scale language data.
