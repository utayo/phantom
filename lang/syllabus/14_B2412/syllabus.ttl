	sylb:method "The Art of the Modern Presentation


Type:Writing/Presentation

Keyword:Discussion,Presentation,Speaking,Web Activities

Course Description:

This class will focus on giving presentations that keep the audience awake and engaged, with or without PowerPoint. It will draw largely from the work of Garr Reynolds of Kansai Gai Dai University, his bestseller Presentation Zen, and his ever-evolving presentation design and delivery website. Students will watch masters of the presentation medium such as Steve Jobs (Apple's late CEO) and Al Gore (from An Inconvenient Truth) and attempt to adopt their habits and strategies to deliver effective and engaging presentations in English.



Learning outcomes:

In this class you will learn how to effectively...

prepare for a presentation
deliver a presentation
build professional-looking slides
...all in English, and all without putting your audience to sleep!



Teacher's comment:
The schedule listed here may change with class size. If we have a very small class, we can do more small presentations and discuss all of them very informally. The class will be like a weekly workshop. With a larger class, we will still workshop each other's presentations, but it will be in small groups, and we will have to spend more time on watching presentations. Either way, attendance/participation is an important part of this class--how can you give a presentation with no audience? Even though the presentations will be individual, we will approach them as a group. What you learn in this class will apply to presentations in any language; I hope you'll continue to make interesting and engaging presentations for years to come!

Type:Reading

Keyword:Discussion,Extensive Reading,Vocabulary,Web Activities

Course Description:

In this course students will work on developing their reading fluency by reading a large number of texts in English. Students will be able to self-select from a large library of online novels from X-Reading, with the goal of choosing novels that are easy to read, relatively short, and of interest to the students. Everyone will read different stories outside of class, with class time used to discuss and share what has been read, examine similarities and differences in how the stories were written, and share strategies for reading fluently in English. Through this, students will develop not only the ability to read more fluently and easily in English, but they will also develop comprehension skills and knowledge of new vocabulary and common phrases. Most importantly, everything that is read is selected by the students, so this should be a fun and practical way to engage in reading in English.



Learning outcomes:

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

Read at a higher rate of fluency
Describe and apply effective strategies for reading comprehension in English
State a range of strategies for using reading to develop vocabulary in English
Discuss, summarize, and analyze novels in English in relation to themes, characters, and settings


Teacher's comment:
We will read a lot for this class, but the reading is designed to be fun and not very difficult. You will have the chance to choose what you read and thus read about things that are interesting to you, and furthemore share those interests with your classmates through activities and discussions. Our goal is to make reading in English a more natural and fun process—just like reading in your native language.

Keyword:Discussion,Listening,Presentation,Project,Speaking,Vocabulary,Writing

Course Description:

Are you confident in speaking English in front of people?  Are you comfortable presenting to in English?  In this course, you will use drama games, role plays, and techniques of Story Theatre to practise story telling in English.  In an active environment you will work in teams to present stories using story-telling, acting, movement and even music if you want to.



Learning outcomes:

Through group work, you will learn to listen effectively to real conversation and live English. You will learn to clarify your meaning and explain things so that others understand you. You will learn techniques that will enable you to confidently join discussions in English.

Through performing, you will learn to use your voice clearly and confidently in front of an audience; you will be aware of the important moments in your presentation and how to express them; and move naturally and comfortably when you are presenting in front of others.

 



Teacher's comment:
When you are doing presentations or joining group discussion in English, you need to be clear and confident.  You need to communicate your ideas so that others understand you.   You need to be interesting so that you hold people's attention.  That's a lot of pressure!

There are many classes where you can practice presenting.  (And practice, and practice, and become very good.)  This class takes a different approach - you will do activities that help you become clear, confident and interesting in front of other people.  You can apply those skills to presenting, meetings, and any other situation that you want to.  

We have so much fun learning this way.  Come and join us!

Type:Writing/Presentation

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Film,Listening,Presentation,Project,Speaking,Vocabulary,Web Activities

Course Description:

This is a B level project presentation class where students can choose a theme connected to the United States of America and then make a 10 minutes presentation. We will use ideas connected to America and American Studies in this class. American Studies deals with American history, cultural representations and foreign policy and helps us to understand how people in the United States think about their country and others. After the Second World War the United States became the most important nation in the world. Every nation has some kind of relationship with the United States, which is either profitable or unprofitable. No nation can ignore to understand American history, culture and foreign policy, if it wishes to develop a profitable relationship with the United States. Along the way we would also question the methods and perspectives by which we study our subject by using a variety of evidence such as books, novels, films, and material culture.



Learning outcomes:

Students will be able to critically examine issues related to American studies, culture, history and foreign policy, interact with invited speakers and make extended oral presentations in English. Students will be able to understand and discuss concepts related to democratic aspirations, justice, manifest destiny, unilateralism, American solidarity, national identity and the American empire. Since students will make oral presentations and write short responses in English, they will also be able to develop their ability to understand complex ideas, answer questions posed to them and prepare handouts of their presentation in an organized fashion.



Teacher's comment:
If you like America you will enjoy this class. Please write your responses and participate in discussions. Remember that class participation, weekly reports and attendance constitute 60% of your final grade. Please submit all assignments in class on the due date. Let's enjoy this class.

Type:Grammar

Keyword:Business English,Discussion,Grammar,Listening,Speaking,Vocabulary,Web Activities

Course Description:

This class is designed to help students achieve the highest possible score on the TOEIC but will be found appropriate by those wanting to go beyond the fundamentals of English grammar as well. The class will review grammar forms and structures that are most likely to be found on the TOEIC and that reflect the most important resurrent trouble spots for language learners. Students will be asked to complete TOEIC-style exercises at home, discuss why the wrong answers are wrong in groups, in class and finally take some review tests. Moreover, students will know which of their skills are the weakest by taking some practice tests provided by U-CAT (online TOEIC practice system). Although the main focus is on grammar, students will take a short listening/reading test at the beginning of each class and get opportunities for speaking practice on work-related topics  in order to be familiar with the format and content of the other parts of the TOEIC.  This class is NOT a teacher-centered class, so active participation in group/class discussions is essential.



Learning outcomes:

By the end of this semester, (1)students will be aware of where their problem areas are, how they budget time, and what test-taking skills are needed to increase scores on the TOEIC and (2)they will develop the grammar, listening, and reading skills necessary to communicate accurately and appropriately.



Teacher's comment:
(1) Students who can take this class are those who attended the first class and those who have NEVER taken this class before. (2) Students will be asked to pay about 3,000 yen for using U-CAT.

Academic Modules

Type:Reading

Keyword:Academic English,Discussion,Grammar,Listening,Speaking,Vocabulary,Writing,IELTS,Test-taking

Course Description:

This course is a combination listening, reading, writing and speaking course suitable for students with a TOEFL score between 480 and 524.  It is designed to give and introduction to IELTS and develop test-taking and language skills needed to do well in IELTS Academic Modules.  Students will be exposed to IELTS format, directions and task requirements which should allow students to focus on their language proficiency during the test.  Students will also look at and practice skills required to perform better in IELTS.  Building vocabulary is also an important part of this course.

To aid students in developing a logical argument in response to the questions posed in the Academic Speaking and Writing Modules of IELTS, writing will be used as reinforcement.  This will be process writing, which is an approach to writing that focuses on the promotion of the development of language use through brainstorming, group discussion and re-writing.  This approach can have any number of stages, though this course will typically be: generating ideas by brainstorming and discussion, extending ideas into note form and judging quality and usefulness of ideas, developing ideas into linear form, writing the first draft, reading of the drafts which are then returned and improvements are made based upon feedback, and finally, writing the final draft.

All homework, assignments and quizzes for this course will be done through Moodle.



Learning outcomes:

This course will focus on helping learners to improve speaking and writing skills, specifically for IELTS, by better understanding the requirements of the test and helping students present a logical argument through knowledge and practice of academic skills and general repetitive practice.  Main objectives include:

improving vocabulary and grammar
becoming familiar with the test format, instructions and questions
developing academic skills
extending speaking skills
Other objectives include:

forming a logical argument
reinforcing language skills
extending reading skills
extending writing skills
This course is best suited for students who:

have TOEFL scores between 480 and 524
are comfortable taking instruction and participating in English
are happy to perform pair and group work
are keen to improve their test-taking skills
In the first class students may be required to write a short essay.  During the essay, students will be called to conduct a short interview and asked a few questions to determine their English speaking proficiency.  Students can ask questions anytime during the first 90-minute class period.

Successful students must complete all assignments, in addition to regular participation both in-class and on-line to pass the course.  Students must pay attention to University attendance regulations in this class.



Teacher's comment:
This will be a busy course with lots of opportunities to speak and heaps of writing to help you with getting a better score in the academic speaking and writing modules of IELTS.  I will be trying to make it as interesting and as much fun as I can, so don’t be put off the boring nature of the title of the course.  One of my main aims is to help you develop your skills in creating convincing, concise, precise and logical texts and utterances with a short amount of lead time; important skills in everyday communication, not only for the IELTS.

Type:Composition

Keyword:Academic English,Discussion,Intensive Reading,Research,Writing

Course Description:

This class is designed to provide students with the opportunity to experience the intellectual challenges and satisfactions of writing an argumentative research paper on a topic of their choice in the field of EFL(or in other fields). Students choose a controversial issue on a suject area, for instance, English education (e.g. Should English be taught at elementary schools?) and present/defend their point of view using the information gathered. Through this semester-long project, students become accustomed to the process of writing a research paper: Reviewing the techniques/rules necessary for academic writing (e.g. paragraph/essay development), using the library and the Internet to get necessary information, conducting a questionnaire/interview to support their position on the issue, and weaving the work of others into their own research paper in the APA style. At the end of this semester, students must submit a final paper (more than 5 typed pages). In this class, students interact a great deal with one another, so active participation in pair/group work is essential.

Learning outcomes:

By the end of this semester, (1) students will acquire basic steps to writing an argumentative research paper, often a common requirement of many academic courses in English-speaking colleges/universities, (2) they will be familiar with the most frequently used format of references, APA, and (3) they will be aware of cross-cultural issues such as plagiarism.

Teacher's comment:
This class is good for those (1) who are interested in foreign language education / acquisition (2) who want to prepare for academic classes at English-speaking colleges / universities and (3) who have NEVER taken this class before.

Students may be asked to pay 2,500 ~2,800 yen for using Criterion, an online writing evaluation system (This is subject to change depending onthe number of students whowill take this class).

Food as Communication

Type:Project

Keyword:Culture,Discussion,Extensive Reading,Literature,Presentation,Project,Speaking,Vocabulary,Writing

Course Description:

Food is the essence of all cultures; each region, each country, each religion, each society has its specialty. Each delicacy has its history and significance. Thus, to bridge the gap of communities on opposite sides of the globe and to truly understand one another, each person must be willing to learn about, experience, and appreciate the foods of other cultures. Through the sharing of recipes and explanations, foreign strangers can relate to and accept their distant peers, improving and uniting the global community.  this course will explore the  emerging field of  "Food studies" ( http://food-studies.com/ ) as a base for creating the SFC/ cookbook project: http://food-japan.tumblr.com/



Learning outcomes:

Through selected readings and presentations, students will investigate some of the basic food studies issues such as  Who chooses what we eat and why? What are the ethics of eating? How are foods symbolic markers of identity? And, significantly, How is food integrated into classrooms? based on these presentations and discussions philosophical issues surrounding them, the students will create a cookbook project that represents the food cultures of Keio SFC. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1492515071044666/



Teacher's comment:
As this is a language project class, the most important component is daily attendance and PARTICIPATION.  This means being in class, on time, using YOUR English to communicate.  “Being in class, on time,” means just that.  If you need to miss a class whether through illness, school activities, or personal business, please send an appropriate e-mail (before, not after that fact) and keep up with the work.  Daily participation means using English everyday in class.  It does not mean speaking perfectly, it does not mean having the “correct” answer to every question (a good question, for example, “What does that word mean?” is as much participation as a good answer;) BUT you must speak up!

Orientation -  What are Food Studies?
reading - 
Food studies is the critical examination of food and its contexts within science, art, history, society, and other fields. It is distinctive from other food-related areas of study such as nutrition, agriculture, gastronomy, and culinary arts in that it tends to look beyond the mere consumption, production, and aesthetic appreciation of food and tries to illuminate food as it relates to a vast number of academic fields. It is thus a field that involves and attracts philosophers, historians, scientists, literary scholars, sociologists, art historians, anthropologists, and others.

第2回 #2
Food History - What is food heritage? the compilation of the historic places, people, institutions, plants, animals that created the foods we know today. Most of us have childhood memories of food places—maybe a restaurant, or a market where the vendors gave us free pieces of fruit. As more and more chain restaurants serving frozen preapportioned meals spread across the US and some of the rest of the world, much is being lost—Healthy food. Local sourcing. Personal stories. And more.  What about local orchards and groves? Old vineyards, breweries and fish markets?  As we lose our connection with our food, and with the people who grow and process it, we lose much of our cultural history and identity. When we seek out the stories of our food heritage, this is food history.  food only that sustain us, but it also reveals the story of the ancestors who nurtured, domesticated, processed and cooked these foods. In our project  we need to explore where food history has been made, and spotlight the people who continue to preserve these traditions.

discussion :  form a group with the other people who researched the same homework assignment. together prepare a brief explanation of what your food research tells us about Japan's food heritage. Please focus on food history and culture; use personal stories from the group that highlight your ideas. be ready to share your information with the class. 

Often a culture's food history and aesthetics is reflected in the way food enters the daily language.  Here is a list of english idioms using food:

AND the information needed to explain the importance of your quote.

vocabulary word  = rhetoric

Rhetoric is the rules of argumentation and presentation.  Each language has its own set of rules for information organization and support. If we want to present well in English, we need to understand English rhetoric. The rules of english rhetoric come from Aristotle (who wrote a book called Rhetoric for his students 2,300 years ago.) One component of rhetoric is the selection and organization of information necessary to include for a report to be considered complete. English-language presentations often use the Interrogative method for this purpose. The

the Six Interrogatives, or Five Ws, Five Ws and one H,  are questions whose answers are considered basic in information-gathering. They are often mentioned in journalism (cf. news style), research, and investigations. They constitute a formula for gathering information on a subject.  According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions:

Who is it about? What happened? Where did it take place? When did it take place? Why did it happen? Some investigators add a sixth question, “how”, to the list, though "how" can also be covered by "what", "where", or "when": How did it happen?  Each question should have a factual answer —  Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." When we have organized the factual answers to these 5 questions, we have the information for the opening of an English presentation

Homework: 

vocabulary word - aesthetics = the theory and study of the concepts of beauty. what is the relationship between food and beauty?

 

Please bring a HARD COPY of your journal to class next week 

第4回 #4
Food Aesthetics
 read this short passage, and be ready to share your ideas. 

Vision is crucial in identifying ingredients, their quality, and the techniques used, and even has a bearing on the perception of flavor. A dish not displayed traditionally may "not taste the same," and an unfamiliar color, such as blue, may be off-putting. Japanese diners recognize the importance of eye appeal, to the extent of photographing their meals at restaurants around the world. Their cooks display fanned slices, neat parcels,  sculpted vegetables, and noodles placed in soups. Cut fish displayed without sauces contributes to a clean look. According to Richard Hosking in A Dictionary of Japanese Food, chefs might "spend the day considering the aesthetics of arranging three sardines."
Moritsuke (food arrangement) follows seven basic patterns, including sugimori (strips and slices of food in a slanting pile), kasanemori (overlapping slices), tawaramori (blocks or rounds placed horizontally in a pyramid), and so on. Illustrating invention within a highly regulated framework, the shojin ryori cookery tradition arranges food like a seasonal landscape—perhaps blue mountains in summer, red in autumn, brown in winter, and flowery in spring. The resulting scene is so abstract that it may appear as one or two objects on a plate to the untutored eye.  As Japanese cooks and diners also appreciate, food is framed by the plate, which might be a beautiful object in its own right, and by the table setting; by other foods, including drinks; by decorations, such as flowers; and by a garden outlook or streetscape.

第6回 #6
presentation 2 - tools of analysis

How do we present ideas (rather than information) and PERSUADE the audience to listen?

Information is the same everywhere - it consists of facts, research, data; when we want to present our findings we need to think again about rhetoric. As we have seen, English rhetoric goes back to Aristotle, and so does its analytical basis - logic. Aristotle was wanted his students not only to be good speakers, but to be able of building a strong argument (logos) and recognizing a "false" argument. So he wrote another book called - Logic. 

Logic like rhetoric is culturally based, so to present well in english we need to understand the basis of english logical structure.  The key concept is "linear development," this means we develop one clear idea through a series of "logical" steps (example: A=B, B=C therefore A=C.) These steps are referred to as an Aristotelean Syllogism ( it means a logical argument.)  This structure is implicit in almost every persuasive presentation in English. Although Aristotle "invented" the syllogism it was a Roman lawyer named Cicero who applied it to making a formal presentation. He was famous for his brilliant court speeches; in fact he was so famous that even today students in English-speaking cultures memorize his oration (new word -look it up!) in the case against Cataline, a man who was plotting to overthrow the government. (We can still see high school students wrapped in there old bed sheets giving this speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLFu45VifuY)

Cicero wrote a book about how to make the best court case and his concept is called - inventio (what english word is related to this latin root?) He said that the order in which we present our argument is as important as our information. Here is the order as we use it today:

I. Introduction - the topic and the thesis statement with a concluding sentence that stresses WHY this argument is important to the audience.

II. Summary - the basic and BRIEF factual information that the audience will need in order to follow your argument.

III. The Body of the Evidence - the key findings you have made with concrete examples to illustrate each separate finding.

IV. Contra - the answers to the arguments against your idea. This is usually supported by background (non-original) research i.e. other people's ideas and information that support your position.

V. Conclusion - restate your main concept. 

when we look at this structure - ONE idea, defined, supported, researched and restated, we see the basic structure of English presentations.  You may notice that this argumentation structure is similar to the structure of the 5 paragraph essay.  This is because this is how students in English speaking cultures learn how to order information and their ideas clearly and persuasively in both written and oral presentations.  These  five steps of analysis let us present our information in English in a way our audience can easily follow and thus be persuaded by OUR ideas.  

Here is a typical persuasive writing and speaking (i.e. rhetoric) page for a high school in Montana:

http://www.hhs.helena.k12.mt.us/Teacherlinks/Oconnorj/persuasion.html

Can you identify - 

a reference to Aristotle/Cicero and the ancient roots of rhetoric?

a guide to ordering the argument (first, second etc.)

a reference to types of evidence ( remember Aristotle's three ideas.)

	sylb:method "An Integrated Approach to Language Skills


Type:Composition

Keyword:Academic English,Discussion,Intensive Reading,Listening,Speaking,Web Activities,Writing

Course Description:

This class is designed to prepare students for the iBT TOEFL but will be good for those wanting to succeed academically in English-speaking colleges and universities as well. The new TOEFL test is different from the paper version of the test in that it puts more emphasis on authentic communication; the test requires test-takers to use not only all four language skills (listening, reading, speaking, writing) in isolation but a combination of two or more of those skills. This means no longer would students be able to boost up their overall score just by studying grammar. In response to the change, an integrated-skills approach will be incorporated in this class; students will be provided with tasks that challenge them to use more than one skill at a time. For instance, students will synthesize and summarize the academic lectures they have heard/read and present it through speaking or writing. Students will complete these tasks in pairs/groups in class or individually at home. In addition to these integrated tasks, students will write essays on a variety of TOEFL-type topics using Criterion (online writing evaluation system) developed by ETS. Good attendance and active participation in class are essential. 

Learning outcomes:

By the end of this semester, (1) students will develop the essential skills needed to successfully communicate in English-speaking academic settings and (2) students will familiarize themselves with the type of questions, format and length of the new TOEFL.

Teacher's comment:
(1) Students who can take this class are those who attended the first class and those who have NEVER taken this class before. (2) Students will be asked to pay 2,500-2,800 yen for using Criterion.

	sylb:method "Video Translation


Type:Composition

Keyword:Culture,Film,Liguistics,Presentation,Project,Vocabulary,Web Activities

Course Description:

This course is firmly based on the idea that language is a powerful reflection of cultural values, and therefore uses translation as a means to explore the workings and characteristics of our own language as well as those of English. Making use of subtitled/dubbed movies and TV shows as material, we will mainly work on Japanese to English translations. In every class, we will challenge ourselves with the task of creating our own "sub-channel" scripts or subtitles. It is an activity-based course in which students are expected to learn from practical experience and experimentation, creativity imagination and humor will be highly appreciated. We will also be working towards a common goal- producing a dubbed ("fukikae") English version of a segment from a Japanese video of your choice in groups. In the beginning of the course we will work on English-language videos translating the subtitles or dubbed versions and "re-creating" the English scripts.  After writing Japanese dub scripts for English videos for a few weeks, we finally move on to using Japanese materials to create the English versions.

In class, we will use short video segments and work on the translation in pairs or small groups. Class activities will basically follow the same procedure every week:

Watching the video segment
Translating and discussing in pairs or groups
Presenting the script sharing each other's work
Comparing our versions with the original version
Discussing the work and material


Learning outcomes:

Developing language awareness: Exploring the range of expressions in each language, choosing words with context and register in mind, becoming aware of the connotative meanings that go beyond dictionary definitions
Developing cultural awareness: Reflecting on the cultural underpinnings of the structure/vocabulary of each language, translating the "untranslatable", regarding translation as a vehicle for exporting Japanese language/culture
Thinking critically: Sharpening observation and analysis becoming able to discuss and present insights in English
Working collaboratively: Gaining inspiration and different perspectives through the exchange of ideas among peers
Discovering the art of translation: Finding out about the profession and basic skills required in making dubs/subtitles
Appreciating bilingual broadcasts and movies: Learning from the materials themselves which provide a rich source of authentic language and culture and can thus promote cultural understanding


Teacher's comment:
The work we do in this course has always been a valuable learning experience not only for my students but also for myself. It's amazing how much we learn about our own language as well as about English through the creative process of translation. The project videos presented by the students every semester are well-produced and very entertaining. I warmly invite you to join us in our exploration of language and culture, and look forward to seeing many of you in class. (Students who have already taken the class are advised NOT to take it again.)

	sylb:method "Learning English through Movies


Type:Oral

Keyword:Culture,Film,Project,Speaking,Vocabulary

Course Description:

 This course is designed to enhance oral communication skills (listening and speaking) through watching movies in English. Students will also be expected to practice their reading and writing skills, for example, by script reading/writing and reading movie reviews on IMDb.com. We will study the scripts together to learn common phrases and expressions in context. There will be dictation exercises and quizzes. Students will be expected to develop their own scripts eventually, utilizing what they learned in and outside class. Weekly, students will write up what they discussed in group work and submit the report to get feedback from the instructor/SA. Most importantly, at the end of the semester, students will make their own movie in English, just as if they are real actors! Attention should be paid to not only linguistic aspects but also paralinguistic features such as tone and stress, as well as nonverbal aspect such as facial expressions and gestures appropriate to the dialogue they created.



Learning outcomes:

 Students will be able to practice not only listening and speaking but also reading and writing. They will be able to learn useful phrases in context as well as interactional patterns shown in the films. Hopefully they will feel comfortable using English without hesitation after immersing themselves in English through this class.



Teacher's comment:
As I stated above, attendance will constitute 10% of the final grade of the course. If you miss more than four classes, you will NOT pass this course. (In other words, absence due to extenuating circumstances is allowed up to three times.) If you are more than twenty minutes late, it will be counted as absence.


Student participation in class discussions is highly recommended. It’s OK if you feel you are not yet a competent speaker of English! I want you to become comfortable expressing yourselves in English, and I will be there to help!

Critical Thinking

Type:Writing/Presentation

Keyword:Business English,Culture,Discussion,Extensive Reading,Grammar,Intensive Reading,Presentation,Research,Speaking,Vocabulary,Web Activities,Writing

Course Description:

Students are to read latest articles from weekly news  magazine (mainly Time and occasionally Newsweek) . Students will be given 2 or 3 articles every class ( they are to choose one for classwork and one for homework). Each student will read, summarize, and analyze one article in class and one at home. Articles will vary from economics, politics to science and culture but students will be given various types of articles every week.  All summaries done at home must be hand-written and handed in for the instructor to check the grammar.  Analysis will be presented orally in class.  Written versions of mid-term and final presentations are to be handed in on the last day of the class ( not electronically).



Learning outcomes:

There will be articles on international politics,  global economics, different fields in science, environmental problems, culture and so forth.  By reading news, it can be expected that the students increase not only their English ability but their knowledge regarding these topics.  It is important that students get acquainted with world news and what is actually going on in this world.  This course should be an asset to their studies and to their future careers.  The instructor will explain each article's background as much as possible; furthermore,  the instructor will also explain the expressions or word related to the articles if deemed necessary to enhance the student's understanding.



Teacher's comment:
This course uses various types of articles from various categories for analyses.  Some articles may not interest some people; however, it is important that one be able to understand news one does not like or is not interested.  As the world is getting smaller and smaller, everyone should be familiar with what is actually going on in the world.  By reading news,  students can also increase their reading ability and, moreover, by writing analyses, they can also expect their writing ability to improve. (* Important:  If a student misses 4 classes, he or she will automatically fail the course.)
