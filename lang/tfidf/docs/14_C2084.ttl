Quantum information processing (QIP) is a fast-growing, interdisciplinary field spanning both classical computer science and quantum physics. QIP is addressing fundamental questions about computability, and the technologies being developed in QIP-related research will have a powerful impact on classical computing as the evolution of IT dictated by Moore's Law brings us to the level of building computers out of individual atoms. Over the coming decades, the principles of QIP will be critical to understanding and developing information technologies. Thus, studying QIP is valuable even for students who are not planning research careers in the field.

Classes will include lectures as well as hands-on work in Mathematica.

Depending on available preparation time, some class sessions may be done in "flipped classroom" style, with recorded lectures to be watched before class. More information will be made available at the first class session.
