"Fieldwork" is a type of qualitative research methods that aims to understand our society and culture. In addition to its practical meaning as a research "technique," it is also important to think about (1) one's "standpoint" in identifying and defining one's own "problems/issues," and about (2) one's "communicative competence" in interpreting the findings and to make the results available to the public.

"Fieldwork" is a type of qualitative research methods that aims to understand our society and culture. In addition to its practical meaning as a research "technique," it is also important to think about (1) one's "standpoint" in identifying and defining one's own "problems/issues," and about (2) one's "communicative competence" in interpreting the findings and to make the results available to the public.

This semester, we will emphasize on three issues that are closely interrelated: (1) Conducting field research, (2) (Re)thinking about observing/recording methods, and (3) Understanding research as social actions.

Students will be asked to work on two fieldwork projects throughout the semester, and make the results into video clips. Thus, students should be prepared to learn about shooting/editing videos, particularly if you are not familiar with devices and software.
