This course covers organizations other than corporate entities, namely governmental and not-for-profit entities. Recently stake holders of these entities demand detailed accounting reports and management use various accounting information for planning and control.

Accounting does not exist only for corporate entities but not-for-profit organizations in the private sector. Also we need to know about Japan's governmental financial position related with high debt rate to GDP.

　 This course is presented in two parts. Part one covers the public sector including central and local governments. Students identify and understand the nature and issues of governmental accounting information based on the public finance system. Also we observe, analyze and discuss the corporate accounting approach introduced in the public sector financial reporting recently. Part two examines not-for-profit organizations such as hospitals, educational corporations, foundations and small NPOs. We focus on the accounting functions, contents of accounting standards, decision making process and corporate governance of these private nonprofits. 　This course does not intend to learn how to make accounting data. But it is not easy to understand accounting structures without knowledge of definition of accounting terminology and concepts of accounting. Students who will register this course have already learned basic accounting principles. Management accounting and corporate accounting are strongly recommended prerequisite courses. Students are required to attend class and are strongly encouraged to take an active part in class discussions.
