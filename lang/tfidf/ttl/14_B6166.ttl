Introductory lectures to Islamic World for beginners. Under the situation where the terrorism of Islamic extremists’ groups has become a global threat, this lecture dare to treat the teachings of Islam to look for the original and necessary appearance. This is because, the reality of Islamic world reported by media, or, reality itself of Islamic world, are deviate from the teachings of Islam. In this lecture different kind of topics are discussed such as Arabic language, Islam, Allah, religion, science, worldview, Ramadan, economy and labor, law and human rights, halal and haram, jihad, governance, being human beings, to make clear the truth of Islam. Correct understanding of Islam could be the first step toward coexistence and symbiosis with Muslims. To that purpose, I think this lecture should become an opportunity to correct the prejudice against Islam and its society. It should be noted that a Jordanian post-graduated student will make education experience teachings 3 times (#8,9,10) in this semester.

初学者のためのイスラーム世界の入門講座。イスラーム過激派のテロが世界的な脅威になっている状況の中で、あえて、イスラームの教えについて取り上げ、その本来の姿を訪ねていく。なぜならば、伝えられるイスラーム世界の現実は、あるいは、イスラーム世界の現実そのものが、イスラームの教えそれ自体とは乖離しているからである。アラビヤ語、イスラーム、アッラー、宗教、科学、世界観、ラマダーン、経済と労働、法・人権、ハラールとハラーム、ジハード、ガバナンス、人間であるということなど異なるトピックからイスラームという宗教の真実を明らかにしていく。イスラームに対する正しい理解は、イスラーム教徒との共存共生への第一歩。そのために、この講義がイスラームとその社会に対する偏見を正す契機になればと思う。 なお、今学期は、ヨルダン出身の大学院生の教育体験授業3回（8・9・10回）が含まれる。
