This class deals with the challenges and opportunities societies face in response to sustainability transformation. Global development cannot be dealt as it was in the 20th century, and in the context of 21st century it is important to consider simultaneously social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. In particular, environmental sustainability should be considered as precondition for all other development, as we turn into the new era called "Anthropocene". The goal of this class is to understand the challenges and opportunities for sustainability as a basis for solving problems.
