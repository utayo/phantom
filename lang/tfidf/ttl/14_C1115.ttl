This course will explore conceptual, theoretical, and accumulated knowledge of international security and conflict studies. Security studies in 21st century face with complex and uncertain international trends: 1) rise of emerging powers (how do emerging powers <eg. China, India and Turkey> change the international security order?), 2) asymmetrical threats (terrorism and insurgency activities), 3) proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, 4) emerging importance of new domains (space and cyberspace). Throughout this semester, this course will conduct in-depth lectures and discussion dealing with these emerging trends of international security.

This course will explore conceptual, theoretical, and accumulated knowledge of international security and conflict studies. Security studies in 21st century face with complex and uncertain international trends: 1) rise of emerging powers (how do emerging powers <eg. China, India and Turkey> change the international security order?), 2) asymmetrical threats (terrorism and insurgency activities), 3) proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, 4) emerging importance of new domains (space and cyberspace). Throughout this semester, this course will conduct in-depth lectures and discussion dealing with these emerging trends of international security.

This course is mainly divided into two phases. The first phase deals with contemporary nature of intra- and international conflicts. We begin the course by observing conceptual and empirical aspects of today’s conflict. The course will conduct conflict case studies in Asia, Middle East, and Africa as regions; and terrorism, proliferation of weapons, and ethnic and religious tensions as issue areas. The second phase will deal with the security policy and the strategy. We will investigate phase-dynamics approach (peacetime management, crisis management, deterrence, intervention, post-conflict operations) to security policy, specific sets of policy in each phase, then to evaluate the actual cases.
